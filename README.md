### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm John

I'm making Augmented Reality happen at [Meta](https://about.meta.com/metaverse/).

Previously, my work at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/financial-intelligence-systems) and at [Gro Intelligence](https://gro-intelligence.com/) focused on using AI/ML to make global supply chains more robust. I studied Computer Science and Game Engineering at New York University and AI and Data Science at Harvard University.
