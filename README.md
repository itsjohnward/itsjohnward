### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm John

I'm making Augmented Reality happen at [Meta](https://about.meta.com/metaverse/). I'm also studying part-time for my [masters](https://scholar.harvard.edu/itsjohnward) in Data Science at Harvard.

Previously, my work in [Amazon's Profit Intelligence org](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/financial-intelligence-systems) and at [Gro Intelligence](https://gro-intelligence.com/) focused on using ML and data visualization to make better business decisions.
